            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>The history of Simlipal National Park is closely tied to its establishment as a wildlife sanctuary and 
                later a national park. The region was originally inhabited by local tribal communities, who have
                 coexisted with the natural resources for centuries. The forested area was declared a sanctuary in 
                 1979, with the primary goal of protecting the tiger population. In 1980, it was declared a national 
                 park, and later, in 2007, it became a part of India's Project Tiger program. The park is an important
                  part of Odisha's natural heritage and is recognized for its role in conservation efforts.</p>
